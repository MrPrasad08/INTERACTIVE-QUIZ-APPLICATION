*DESCRIPTION* :  THE INTERACTIVE QUIZ APPLICATION IS A BROWSER-BASED APP BUILT USING HTML, CSS, AND JAVASCRIPT THAT ALLOWS USERS TO ANSWER MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS AND RECEIVE INSTANT FEEDBACK. IT DYNAMICALLY 
                 DISPLAYS QUESTIONS AND ANSWER OPTIONS, HIGHLIGHTS CORRECT OR INCORRECT RESPONSES USING VISUAL CUES, AND TRACKS THE USERâ€™S SCORE THROUGHOUT THE QUIZ. USERS CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH THE QUESTIONS USING A 
                "NEXT" BUTTON, AND UPON COMPLETION, THE APP DISPLAYS THE FINAL SCORE WITH AN OPTION TO RESTART THE QUIZ. THE APPLICATION DEMONSTRATES KEY WEB DEVELOPMENT CONCEPTS SUCH AS DOM MANIPULATION, EVENT 
                HANDLING, CONDITIONAL LOGIC, AND DYNAMIC CONTENT RENDERING, AND CAN BE FURTHER ENHANCED WITH FEATURES LIKE A TIMER, PROGRESS TRACKING, QUESTION RANDOMIZATION, AND SCORE PERSISTENCE USING LOCAL 
                STORAGE OR A BACKEND SYSTEM.
